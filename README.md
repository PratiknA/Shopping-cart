# Shopping-cart
Hi,
Everyone.
In this javascript Project, I created a Fake Shopping Store, By using #fakestoreApi
.Tech Stack used-Javascript , bootstrap

Features-
1). Added Cart System.
2). Category-wise Filtering.

Fully #responsive website.

Some Feature is left to Implement -
1). Payment Gateway
2). Login and Logout - Validation
3). Amount calculation.

During building this I learn many things Like how Online Store Works - How they implemented their features.

I am taking Step - By- Step in this Frontend Development Career
